# Decrypt passwords encrypted using crypt (DES)
OpenMP implementation of an algorithm implementing a brute-force attack to decrypt an eight-character passwords encrypted with DES. 
The aim of this work is to compare the computational costs of a sequentail and a parallel version of a brute-force attack on password, evaluating the speedup achieved in several test situations through parallelization.

## Overview
This project is a mid term project for the course of Parallel Computing, held by professor Marco Bertini at University of Florence.

## Requirements
In order to run the code are required:
- OpenMP
- C++17 or newer
